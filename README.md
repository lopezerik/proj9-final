# :calendar: Meeting App :calendar:
Create and share a meeting with multiple people in your group.   
Uses your Google Calendar in order to get your availability for the meeting.   

# Multiple Users
Uses mongoDB to keep state and allow for multiple users to coordinate on a meeting.  

# Reworked
I reworked the code from the last version to be much more modular / clean.  
The final time display is also much better with the rework.  

# Google API
Makes use of the Google Calendar API to pull events from your Google Calendar(s).  

# Deployment
Deployed the same as past projects. If this was hosted on a service it would be accessible from a specific URL.
